# üöÄ Production Deployment Checklist

## Current Status: NOT DEPLOYED ‚ùå

We've made critical security improvements that need to be deployed ASAP.

## What's Ready to Deploy

### ‚úÖ Security Improvements
- 5 new secure API routes (v2) with authentication
- Security middleware blocking dangerous routes
- Input validation with Zod
- Rate limiting infrastructure
- Production logging with Pino

### ‚úÖ UI Improvements  
- New expandable individual results view
- Better visual design with badges and pills
- Enhanced filtering and search

## Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Environment Variables (REQUIRED)
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard or .env.production
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<generate-with: openssl rand -base64 32>
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. Test Locally
```bash
# Build and test
npm run build
npm run start

# Visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard
# Verify login works
```

### 3. Commit Changes
```bash
# Add all security improvements
git add -A

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "CRITICAL: Add production security improvements

- Implement authenticated API routes (v2)
- Add input validation with Zod
- Block dangerous routes in production
- Add rate limiting infrastructure
- Improve individual results UI with expandable cards
- Add comprehensive security documentation

BREAKING: Old API routes deprecated, use v2 endpoints"
```

### 4. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 5. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Option A: Automatic (if connected to GitHub)
# Push will trigger auto-deploy

# Option B: Manual deploy
vercel --prod
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### ‚úÖ Critical Checks
1. [ ] Visit https://yourdomain.com/dashboard
2. [ ] Verify login works
3. [ ] Check that /admin requires password
4. [ ] Test creating a campaign
5. [ ] Verify dangerous routes return 404:
   - [ ] /api/admin/flush-storage
   - [ ] /api/test-storage
   - [ ] /api/debug

### ‚úÖ Monitor for Errors
```bash
# Watch Vercel logs
vercel logs --follow

# Check for any 500 errors
# Check for authentication issues
```

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

```bash
# If issues occur:
vercel rollback

# Or revert commit and redeploy
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## Why This Deployment is CRITICAL

### üî¥ Current Security Risks (UNPATCHED IN PRODUCTION)
1. **Anyone can delete your database** - `/api/admin/flush-storage` is unprotected
2. **All company data exposed** - No authentication on API routes
3. **Unlimited spam possible** - No rate limiting
4. **SQL injection possible** - No input validation

### üü¢ After Deployment
- All API routes require authentication
- Dangerous routes blocked in production
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

## Deployment Commands Summary

```bash
# Quick deploy sequence
git add -A
git commit -m "Add production security improvements"
git push origin main

# Verify deployment
vercel ls
vercel inspect [deployment-url]
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel dashboard for build errors
2. Review logs: `vercel logs`
3. Test locally first: `npm run build && npm run start`

**This deployment adds critical security that your engineer explicitly requested. Deploy ASAP to protect your production data.**
